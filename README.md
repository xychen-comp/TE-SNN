# TE-SNN 

This repository contains the implementation of the experiments from the paper **"Temporal structure encoding for accurate and robust temporal processing in spiking neural networks"**. The code is structured to reproduce all experiments efficiently using provided scripts.

## Dependencies
To run this code, you need the following dependencies:

- Python `3.9.13`
- NumPy `1.23.4`
- PyTorch `1.13.0`
- CUDA `11.6` 
- Librosa `0.8.0` (for audio processing in the GSC dataset)

ðŸ“Œ *Note*: The autonomous driving task requires additional dependencies, which are listed in `Autonomous_driving/README.md`.

## Project Structure

Each category of tasks is stored in a separate folder.

## Runing Experiments
### Runing Standard Benchmarks 

The following method applies to all tasks except the autonomous driving task.
1. **Set the dataset path:** 

   Before running, update the corresponding script (e.g., `Spiking_MNIST/run_smnist.py`) by replacing all `/path` with your actual dataset location. 
  
    ðŸ“Œ *Note*: For scripts in `Synthetic_tasks`, no dataset path is required.


2. **Execute the experiment (e.g., S-MNIST):**

   Once the dataset path is correctly set, you can run all four experiments (TE-SFNN-R, TE-SFNN-N, TE-SRNN-R, TE-SRNN-N) sequentially using:

    ```sh
    cd Spiking_MNIST
    python run_smnist.py
    ```
    This approach applies to **GSC, PTB, SHD, Spiking_MNIST, and Synthetic_tasks**. 

### Running the Autonomous Driving Task

The autonomous driving task has unique dependencies and setup requirements. Please refer to `Autonomous_driving/README.md` for detailed instructions on installing the necessary packages and running the experiment.
